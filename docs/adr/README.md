# Financial Components Architecture Decision Records

Welcome to the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) repository for the **Financial Components** stream of the Application Modernization Program (AMP) in the Information Services Divison (ISD) of the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction (SDPR) for the Government of British Columbia.

This repository contains all the architectural decisions made during the development of the Financial Components. ADRs help us document significant decisions that shape our project.

## Viewing the ADRs

ADRs are automatically published to our Log4brains architecture knowledge base:
